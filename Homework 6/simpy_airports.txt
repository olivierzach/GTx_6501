simulation homework question - isye6501

In this problem you, can simulate a simplified airport security system at a busy airport. Passengers arrive
according to a Poisson distribution with λ1 = 5 per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate µ1 = 0.2 minutes)
to the ID/boarding-pass check queue, where there are several servers who each have exponential
service time with mean rate µ2 = 0.75 minutes. [Hint: model them as one block that has more than one
resource.] After that, the passengers are assigned to the shortest of the several personal-check queues,
where they go through the personal scanner (time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 minutes and 1
minute).

Use the Arena software (PC users) or Python with SimPy (PC or Mac users) to build a simulation of the
system, and then vary the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues to
determine how many are needed to keep average wait times below 15 minutes. [If you’re using SimPy,
or if you have access to a non-student version of Arena, you can use λ1 = 50 to simulate a busier airport.]
